# iban

```js
    // usages
    chance.iabn()
```
Return a random IBAN (International Bank Account Number).

```js
chance.iban();
=> SC57RLNT52810271010038667705GOO
```

Note: Some countries do have a local account number checksum. This is not implemented due complexity, because each country is using different check algorithms.
